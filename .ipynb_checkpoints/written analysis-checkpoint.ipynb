    "[1] All five top performing schools are charters, with 4 falling in the small (<1000) to medium range (1000-2000), and only one large school (2000-5000), though at the bottom end of that range (2,283 students). By contrast, all 5 bottom performing schools are large district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] If we look at spending ranges and passing rates, it would seem that lower spending schools do better.  However, Charter schools tend ot have a lower per student budget, so when we look at lower spending schools as doing better in passing, we cannot readily separate the confounding factors without additional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3] Overall, small and medium schools do better than large, and Charter schools do better than the district schools.  This leads to additional questions: Is this simply a matter of class size differences between Charter schools and District schools? Or are there other details - number of teachers, quality of teacher, volunteers, unique characteristics of the charter schools, demographics of the student body and their families - that might explain the differences? Additional data would need to be obtained in order to analyze in a way that would lead to improved conclusions, including moving towards hypothesis testing analyses."
